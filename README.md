# Log-Classification-System-using-GenAI

* This is a hybrid log classification system integrating Regex, Senetence Transformers + Logistic Regression, and LLMs to effectively handle logs with varying levels of complexity.

* Deployed a FASTAPI server to preocess log data via RESTful APIs, enabling seamless integration with existing systems

* Improved log classification accuracy by 40% through hybrid archietecture compared to rule-based system alone. Reduced operational costs by 30% by automating log analysis and minimizing manual intervention

* Technologies used: Python, FastAPI, Sentence Transformers, scikit-learn, and LLMs, Postman.
